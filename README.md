# Book Search Engine

## Description

A fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This was a very challenging task as there are so many folders and it is eary to get lost in all the different code. I've learned alot especially when to seek outside for assistance. I can surely see the importance of having a team for this line of work.


## Installation
